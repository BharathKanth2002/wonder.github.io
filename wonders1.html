  <div style="float:left;"><p><i>The Great Wall of China  is a series of fortifications that were built across the
     historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic 
     groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,with selective 
     stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang <b>(220-206 BC)</b>, the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.
     Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the 
     wall were built by the Ming dynasty <b>(1368–1644)</b>.Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border 
     controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade
      and the control of immigration and emigration.Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced
       by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or 
       fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.The frontier walls built by different 
       dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the 
       present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the 
       edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall 
       is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.Although it is called the
       "Great Wall of China", part of it used to be located in North Korea.<br></i></p></div>
