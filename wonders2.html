  <div style="float:left; padding: 10px;"><p><i>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy,
     just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest 
     standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) 
     in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made 
     during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian 
     dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro 
     Flavio by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).
    <br><br>
    The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an 
    estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average audience of some 
    65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of 
    famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for entertainment 
    in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, 
    a quarry, and a Christian shrine.
    <br><br>
    Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol 
    of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7] It is one of Rome's most popular tourist
     attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross"
      procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[8] The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version 
      of the five-cent euro coin.<br></i></p></div>
